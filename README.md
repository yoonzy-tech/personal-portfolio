# Personal Portfolio Website
[Click here to see my LIVE website](https://yoonzy.vercel.app/)\
<br />
This is my personal website, which contains my portfolio, resume, and a contact form.\
It is responsive design and has a dark mode option. I built this project as a self-practice for React and to learn about Tailwind for styling from [developedbyed on Youtube](https://youtu.be/k-Pi5ZMxHWY).\
